# Choc3DP
A 3DP for the undercity hackathon in SF, that you guessed it prints chocolate. The only difference between this 3D printer and high end printers like the cocoa press and ones that range up to 2000 dollars is that this uses simplicity, plain chocolate, and normal DIY build materials, (with a nice board as an exception.) This printer encompasses the main problem of every programmer, we need more chocolate in our lives. Therefore, we invented (engineered) the Choc3DP, a revolutionary 3D printer that prints chocolate.

## The main issue:
There are many 3D printers out there that already achieve the same thing, print chocolate, but at what cost, and at what labor and time? Instead of spending so much on the expensive printers, and buying specific filaments that you need to get the printer working, you could also achieve all of this with your normal hersheys milk chocolate, which is found in a lot of households and supermarkets, and melts easily.

## How did the build go?:
We spent a lot of time perfecting the build and making sure that there is no error, which took a while because aluminum foil is not even and out rack and pinion system was not the most accurate either. But in the end we got working prints which is shown in the images below!
